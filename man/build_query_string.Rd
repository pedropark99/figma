\description{
Utility function used to build query strings (non-exported function).
}
\details{
This function takes a set of key-value pairs (or in other words,
a set of named arguments), to build a query string. It basically
combine (or "collapse") all key-value pairs together, to form
the resulting query string.

Logical values (TRUE or FALSE) are automatically converted to
a lower-case version ("true" or "false"), since these versions are
more typically used in standard query strings.
